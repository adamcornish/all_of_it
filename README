This is the pipeline to run variant calling using GATK when given a single sample. In its current incarnation, it must be PE data.

The script can be run from any folder, but note that the output files will be placed in the folder that you run the script from.

Usage: perl gorrammit.pl <configuration_file.txt>

    Your configuration file MUST have a READS_DIR specified.
